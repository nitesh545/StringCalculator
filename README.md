# String calculator in Rust

## Commit 1: first commit
Created directory and pushed to github.

## Commit 2: empty string should give sum 0
Empty string as input to my function ```sum()``` should render the output 0.

## Commit 3: string with 1 number
A string like ```"1"``` gives output ```1```.

## Commit 4: string upto 2 numbers
A string like ```"1, 4"``` should give output ```5```.

## Commit 5: string with multiple numbers
A string like ```"1, 4, 2, 8"``` should give output ```15```.<br>
Test case passed in first run without modifying code. Code from last commit was good enough.

## Commit 6: string with whitespace like next line
A string like ```"1\n5, 4"``` should give output ```10```.
